# To-Do- Work Space UI (Team Work Space UI)

## The front-end of a fully functional application that is a collaborative task management tool designed to help teams organize and prioritize their work efficiently.

This project drew inspiration from ServiceNow's existing model to establish an effective process for teams to more efficiently manage their tasks. Within the TeamTaskManager system, user management is structured around distinct roles, primarily Admin and User, each with specific permissions and restrictions. Administrators possess elevated privileges such as: updating employee information, creating a new employee in the system, and deleting employees from the system. On the other hand, regular Users have restricted access, typically limited to task creation, assignment, updates, and completion. By implementing this role-based approach, TeamTaskManager offers a tailored experience for users based on their responsibilities, fostering a secure and efficient collaborative environment.
